## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.8

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

Working within a virtual environment is recommended.

#### PIP Dependencies

navigate to the `/backend` directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the Frontend

The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use ```npm start```.

```bash
npm start
```
## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory

To run the server:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
OR

```bash
set FLASK_APP=flaskr
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

## Testing
To run the tests:
```
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
Omit the dropdb command the first time you run tests.
